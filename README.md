# 💖 Valentine Surprise Website (for Nishi) 💖

A tiny romantic (and slightly mischievous 😌) Valentine webpage.

It starts with a **Welcome animation**, then smoothly transitions into the big question:

## 🌸 “Nishi, Will you be my Valentine? ❤️”

And yes… the **NO button runs away** because the universe has already decided. 😤💘  
If someone tries to chase “No” for too long, the **YES button grows bigger** (as it should).  
After clicking **YES**, there’s a **typewriter love note**, and a **funny GIF pops up outside the box** like a little celebration sticker. 😂✨
